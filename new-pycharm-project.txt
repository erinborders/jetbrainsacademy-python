The first option is the path to a new virtual environment. You can think of a virtual environment as of an isolated “pseudo” Python distribution with its own features: available libraries, version of Python and pip, the Python built-in package manager, which allows you installing external libraries. Base interpreter is the path to real Python, which you download and install to your computer.

Let’s say you have downloaded Python 2.7 and installed it into C:/python2.7, and Python 3.7 – C:/python3.7.

Now if you want to create a new project on Python 2.7, you will choose C:/python2.7/python.exe as the base interpreter for this project. In case you want to start a new project on Python 3.7, you will choose C:/python3.7/python.exe as the base interpreter for a project, written on Python 3.7.

Each of these projects will have its own dependencies – the libraries available and needed for a specific project
